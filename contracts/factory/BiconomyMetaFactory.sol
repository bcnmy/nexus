/// @title BiconomyMetaFactory
/// @notice Manages the creation of Modular Smart Accounts compliant with ERC-7579 and ERC-4337 using a factory pattern.
/// @dev Utilizes the `Stakeable` for staking requirements.
///      This contract serves as a 'Meta' factory to generate new Nexus instances using specific chosen and approved factories.
/// @dev Can whitelist factories, deploy accounts with chosen factory and required data for that factory.
///      The factories could possibly enshrine specific modules to avoid arbitrary execution and prevent griefing.
